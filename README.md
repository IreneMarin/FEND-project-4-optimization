-----------------------------------------------

### Udacity's instructions

1. Review our course on Website Performance Optimization using Google PageSpeed.
2. Download the required project assets.
3. Use Chrome Developer Tools to review the current state of various pages within the application and identify areas for improvement.
4. Review the code powering the website and identify areas where you believe modifications are warranted.
5. Iteratively make changes and test those changes using the tools available to you to determine if they are a performance gain or loss.



You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).
